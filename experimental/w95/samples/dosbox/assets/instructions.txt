Welcome to w95's DOSBox sample!

This sample demonstrates the integration of DOSBox (using the js-dos web wrapper) into the w95 UI.

Double-click one of the DOSBox shortcut icons on the top left of your screen to start the corresponding DOS program.


Notes:
------
- Due to limitations in the version of js-dos used, there can be only one active instance of DOSBox at a time.

- You may run into occasional issues, like the DOSBox image shrinking, keyboard input freezing, and/or general lagginess in the w95 UI while DOSBox is running.
