Meet faux Internet browser, a superficial replica of Microsoft's Internet Explorer 4, built with the w95 UI framework! (Not associated with Microsoft.)

This mock browser lets you stream websites from the Internet Archive, potentially viewing them as you did back in the 1990s.


How to use
===========
1. Click on the fake browser's address bar.

2. Type in the URL of the website you want to visit, then press Enter. After a short while, the browser will display the website as it might've appeared in the 1990s.

3. Use the year dropdown selector, to the right of the address bar, to wish for a version of the website from a particular year.


Issues
======
- You can expect to come across various issues when browsing. Don't worry about it.

- Some websites will attempt to navigate your real browser when you click on a link. To warn you in advance, your browser will ask you whether you want to allow the navigation to take place.

- The Back and Forward buttons of the fake browser navigate your real browser's history.

...And other issues for you to discover!
