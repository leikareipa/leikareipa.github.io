TYPE RALLY TO PLAY RALLY-SPORT

Few last minute notes:

- Setsound.exe will probably crash
   because sound_driver is just a testversion.
  * turn sounds off in gamemenu to play
    without sound!
- bridges are not finished, so you can
  use like shortcuts...

(future versions will copy right settings from
set enviroment table!)
