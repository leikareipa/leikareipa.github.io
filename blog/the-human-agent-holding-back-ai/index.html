<dokki-topic title="The human agent holding back AI">
<p>I speculated <a href="/blog/is-gpt-4-agi/">in a previous blog post</a> that humans performing agentic duties for the current crop of agentless LLMs are holding back their potential (post-AGI FTW). Here's an example of where this appears to be happening.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/claude-3s-exceptional-abilities-at-obscure-languages/">In my view</a> and in line with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13813">early research</a>, Claude 3 Opus categorically surpasses GPT-4 in multilingual capability, specifically in endangered languages. It appears to be new state of the art and should be able to project an effect onto small language communities and related activities.</p>
<p>I emailed a few linguists in this space in early March, hoping to catch their views on it and maybe spur some research into it. These particular researchers were unaware of Claude 3 at the time but also strangely enough have for a couple of months now been on the fence about giving it a spin.</p>
<p>The fact that you need to sign up for an API to use Claude 3 in Europe seems to be a hindrance for them. They've expressed interest in testing a chat version, but the feet start dragging at the mention of an API. It's odd, because some of these people are supposedly directly involved in machine translation of endangered languages.</p>
<p>As I speculated in that previous blog post, human agency may not have enough bandwidth to enable current-gen AI to its full extent, and that seems to be playing out here. You can imagine this eventually leading to an agentic AI eruption, as it's deferring the effects while not preventing underlying progress.</p>
