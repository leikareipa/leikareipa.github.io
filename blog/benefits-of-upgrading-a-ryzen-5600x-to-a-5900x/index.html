<dokki-topic title="Benefits of upgrading a Ryzen 5600X to a 5900X">
<p>Competition between AMD and Intel has been pushing down CPU prices. I hopped on the bandwagon by swapping my Ryzen 5 5600X for a Ryzen 9 5900X.</p>
<p>I'll take a moment in this post to talk about the benefits (and non-benefits) of the upgrade in some of my workflows.</p>

<p>The effect of the display overhead isn't very big, as the 24-core result here is similar to the (24-core) result in the previous test. But it also does appear that the renderer chokes on the 5900X's thread count, negating the benefit of the 12 weaker SMT threads.</p>
<p>Limiting the renderer to 12 threads on the 5900X to avoid the excessive thread-handling overhead, the CPU's performance gain over the 5600X is still in the 30–50% range.</p>

<p>I expected the 5900X to beat the 5600X by more than the 27% seen here, but it's an improvement in any case. That said, seeking (<em>-ss</em>) is a different process from encoding (and different again if given after <em>-i</em> than before it), so it's possible that with a longer clip to encode, the results may have skewed more in favor of the 5900X.</p>
<p>I also ran this test using a single thread. The results showed the 5900X to be almost twice as fast as the 5600X, the former taking about a minute and the latter about two minutes. It's such an extreme difference that I suspect there was a mistake involved. I don't have access to the 5600X any more to verify the result, so take this for what it's worth.</p>

<p>The two CPUs are known to be fairly similar in gaming performance, and the results with this system speak the same language. The test is hitting against GPU rather than CPU limitations.</p>
</dokki-subtopic><dokki-subtopic title="Discussion">
<p>The tests generally showed single-core performance to be similar between the 5600X and the 5900X, while heavy-threaded applications favored the 5900X – as to be expected.</p>
<p>For web developers and non-high-end gamers looking for extra performance, the upgrade from the 5600X to the 5900X doesn't seem worth it. C++ developers and the like would stand to benefit from it more, as would those with video processing purposes. For heavily CPU-bound and parallelizable tasks, the upgrade is solid and borders on twice the performance.</p>
<p>One extra benefit of the 5900X over the 5600X is that in multithreaded applications it can provide a comparable level of performance with noticeably lower heat output when its power draw is manually limited.</p>
<p>Given that the 5900X is currently twice as expensive as the 5600X, the latter seems the more sensible choice of the two overall. On the other hand, the 5900X costs about the same now as what the 5600X did just a year or so ago, so it's good value from that perspective. If you're not already invested in the AM4 platform, the Intel Core i5-13600K is also worth a look for multi-core performance comparable to the 5900X but faster single-core.</p>
