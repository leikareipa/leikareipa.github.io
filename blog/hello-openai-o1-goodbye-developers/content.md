# Hello OpenAI o1, goodbye developers

How's that for toxic clickbait?

Anyway, OpenAI has finally released a preview of their Strawberry, their reasoning AI, now called the o1. Perhaps not an ideal name, but its performance in many ways looks to be a strong improvement over the various previous versions of GPT-4. It seems to be particularly adept at coding and math.

Ironically, as an unemployed developer, I can't actually afford the ChatGPT Plus subscription to test out this new model right now. I'll have to wait until it's generally available via the API to give it a spin. In the meantime, you can [check out my expectations for it](/blog/brief-speculation-about-the-next-gpt/) from last March. Will o1 be able to deliver?

Whatever the case, the meat of it is this new reasoning paradigm that the model represents allows AI to continue scaling with compute. That means for their relevancy human developers are stuck competing against the availability of compute, and the odds aren't in their favor I don't think.
