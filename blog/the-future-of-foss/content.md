# The future of FOSS

I've been releasing free software for a decade now, of which the last five years were dedicated full-time to FOSS. Has it paid off?

No. When I started coding as a hobby, it was for my private amusement and not much more. Taking it public turned it into time-consuming work without compensation or future prospects. An unsustainable lifestyle.

Lately, my interests have been drifting back in the direction of private code, and I wonder, is it just me, or does this reflect an ongoing generational shift in the FOSS community?

## How it might go

The mainstreaming of software development, the competition for entry-level jobs, and the empowering by AI of a new generation of developers produces a bottom-heavy distribution of FOSS contributors, which associates the movement with disposability and accelerates the attrition of longer-term contributors.

New developers in particular will want to adopt AI tools. The vendors of AI models will in turn push for methods of development that don't depend directly on the model's raw output, the source code, which they want to guard for competitive and other reasons, like the internal monologue of the o1.

FOSS will lose new blood to these efforts and, to the extent that AI really takes off, starts to look like a throwback niche.
