<dokki-topic title="Exploring the applicant–HR dynamic with ChatGPT">
<p><a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a> provides an accessible interface to an advanced AI that's internalized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3#Training_and_capabilities">a large volume of data</a> and learned to synthesize conversational answers to users' queries.</p>
<p>Regardless of the extent to which ChatGPT is a reasonable simulation of a human, it can convincingly approximate the responses of a human to various contexts based on responses that have been observed to be generated by real humans in comparable conditions.</p>
<p>In this post, we'll look to see whether we can learn something new about the patterns underlying the applicant–HR dynamic that a developer comes across when applying for work, by experimentally varying the inputs in a controlled environment to a stand-in HR, ChatGPT.</p>

<p>The prompt for the ChatGPT version was for a rejection email for a developer candidate, without further classifiers. So presumably it's ChatGPT's idea of a common rejection email that a developer might get.</p>
<p>The real email was a pre-screening rejection, though I don't know the reason. I do know that emails like it are <a href="/blog/a-brief-analysis-of-generic-rejection-emails-for-developer-jobs/">pretty common</a>.</p>
<p>In any case, ChatGPT appears to show that it can at least to some degree predict formulaic email communication from a real software company. (It's possible that the real email was AI-generated as well, but it's an uncertainty we have to live with.)</p>
</dokki-subtopic><dokki-subtopic title="AI rejection emails for good and poor candidates">
<p>I asked ChatGPT to produce a rejection email for a developer candidate who was a good match for the position. Also asked it to do the same for a candidate who was a poor match.</p>
<p>(I don't know whether ChatGPT considered the quality of the candidate to have been only subjectively established by the writer or a more objective fact.)</p>

                        <pre>Dear [Programmer],

Thank you for submitting your application for the programming position at our software company.

After evaluating the results of our proprietary algorithm, which takes into account factors such as programming skills, relevant experience, and cultural fit, we have determined that the probability of your success in this role is P(x) = 0.35.

To arrive at the value of P(x) for your application, we first identified the key factors that contribute to success in the programming role at our company. These factors included programming skills, relevant experience, and cultural fit.

For each factor, we assigned a weight to reflect its importance in determining success in the role. The weight for programming skills was 0.5, the weight for relevant experience was 0.3, and the weight for cultural fit was 0.2.

Next, we used our proprietary algorithm to evaluate each of these factors and assign a numerical value to them based on the information provided in your application and resume. For example, your programming skills were rated as a 7 out of 10, your relevant experience was rated as a 6 out of 10, and your cultural fit was rated as an 8 out of 10.

Finally, we combined these values using a weighted average to arrive at the overall probability of your success in the role, P(x) = 0.35.

According to our company's acceptance criteria, which requires a probability of P(x) &gt; 0.50, we regret to inform you that your application has been unsuccessful at this time.

We understand that this decision may be disappointing, but please know that it was based on rigorous mathematical analysis and not on subjective opinions. We encourage you to continue pursuing opportunities in the field and hope you will consider applying for future openings within our company.

Thank you again for your interest and we wish you the best of luck in your career endeavors.

<li>Taken in isolation, the paragraph ratings are inconsistent to some extent – like a paragraph being rated lower in an overall lower-rated application than the same paragraph in an overall higher-rated application. Although this might reflect a halo effect, it may also just be AI noise.</li>
<li>On the other hand, the ratings don't appear totally random either, as the best-rated application is clearly more stacked than the worst-rated one.</li>
<li>The wording of the last paragraph of the worst-rated application gives me the impression that the text came from a guide on writing job applications, but quick googling didn't show any obvious matches.</li>

<p>The following trends appeared to emerge when looking over the ChatGPT-derived email exchanges between applicants and HR:</p>
<ul>
<li>Successful applications assert their value rather than submit themselves for evaluation.</li>
<li>Successful applications express a resolve to work for the company rather than a desire to learn more about it.</li>
<li>Successful applications describe the candidate's background and skills by example rather than by adjectives.</li>
<li>The language of a successful application is energetic and forward rather than preliminary.</li>
<li>Self-taughts should jump to pre-dispel concerns about their background and underline their strong fundamentals.</li>
<li>The factors that go into HR's decision may be categorizable like so, potentially from most to least important: cultural fit, relevant experience, programming skill.</li>
<li>Potential response times: weeks for a mediocre candidate, days for a great candidate, hours for a excellent candidate. But this would of course depend on many other factors as well.</li>
<li>Well-perceived applicants who are rejected are told to continue applying for similar roles. Poorly-perceived applicants are told to continue applying for other kinds of roles. Candidates whose application wasn't looked at are told to continue applying for roles that they feel are a good fit. Generally, only well-perceived applicants' qualifications receive comment.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are speculative claims that may or may not have a correlate in reality. But they're not all that radical either, and seem plausible enough.</p>
<p>That said, the way ChatGPT was prompted to produce the data was likely only scratching the surface. The AI was provided relatively little context for its responses, and for example it's clear from some of its output that it considered a successful application to result directly in a job offer rather than an interview, which may have affected the dynamic. Also, as ChatGPT itself is disruptive tech, being associated with it may make these findings volatile even in the case that they're accurate now.</p>
