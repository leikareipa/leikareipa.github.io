# Exploring the applicant&ndash;HR dynamic with ChatGPT

[ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) provides an accessible interface to an advanced AI that's internalized [a large volume of data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3#Training_and_capabilities) and learned to synthesize conversational answers to users' queries.

Regardless of the extent to which ChatGPT is a reasonable simulation of a human, it can convincingly approximate the responses of a human to various contexts based on responses that have been observed to be generated by real humans in comparable conditions.

In this post, we'll look to see whether we can learn something new about the patterns underlying the applicant&ndash;HR dynamic that a developer comes across when applying for work, by experimentally varying the inputs in a controlled environment to a stand-in HR, ChatGPT.

## Sanity check: AI vs. reality

A rejection email from a software company as generated by ChatGPT:

```[{word-wrap}{no-line-numbers}{headerless}]
Dear [Candidate],

Thank you for applying to the [Position] role at our company. We appreciate the time and effort you invested in your application and the opportunity to review your qualifications.

After careful consideration, we have decided to pursue other candidates who are better suited for the position.

We encourage you to continue searching for opportunities that align more closely with your skills and experience.

Thank you again for considering our company, and we wish you the best of luck in your job search.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
```

A rejection email from a real software company:

```[{word-wrap}{no-line-numbers}{headerless}]
Dear [Candidate],
 
Thank you for taking the time to apply for the [Position]. We appreciate your interest and your willingness to join [Company].
 
After a careful review of all applications, we regret to inform you that you have not been selected for an interview for this position.

Please keep yourself posted on new career opportunities at [Social Media]. (…)
 
We wish you success in your job search (…).
 
Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

The prompt for the ChatGPT version was for a rejection email for a developer candidate, without further classifiers. So presumably it's ChatGPT's idea of a common rejection email that a developer might get.

The real email was a pre-screening rejection, though I don't know the reason. I do know that emails like it are [pretty common](/blog/a-brief-analysis-of-generic-rejection-emails-for-developer-jobs/).

In any case, ChatGPT appears to show that it can at least to some degree predict formulaic email communication from a real software company. (It's possible that the real email was AI-generated as well, but it's an uncertainty we have to live with.)

## AI rejection emails for good and poor candidates

I asked ChatGPT to produce a rejection email for a developer candidate who was a good match for the position. Also asked it to do the same for a candidate who was a poor match.

(I don't know whether ChatGPT considered the quality of the candidate to have been only subjectively established by the writer or a more objective fact.)

### Good candidate

```[{word-wrap}{no-line-numbers}{headerless}]
Dear [Candidate],

We were impressed with your qualifications and experience and believe that you would be a strong asset to any team. Unfortunately, we have a limited number of openings and were unable to extend an offer to you at this time.

```

- The good-fit candidate's skills and experience are directly lauded. Responses elicited by the poor-fit candidate say nothing about his qualifications.
- The emails subtly suggest that the poor-fit candidate should 'explore more suitable positions next time,' while for the good-fit candidate the instruction is to continue applying as before.
- In both cases it's claimed that the review process was careful.

## AI's rejection emails for a candidate whose application wasn't looked at

I asked ChatGPT to write a rejection email for a candidate whose application "we didn't look at."

```[{word-wrap}{no-line-numbers}{headerless}]
Dear [Candidate],

Thank you for your interest in the developer position at our company. We appreciate the time and effort you put into your application.

Unfortunately, due to the high volume of applicants we received, we were unable to review your application in detail. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and hope you will continue to consider us for future job opportunities.

Thank you again for your interest in our company.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
```

```[{word-wrap}{no-line-numbers}{headerless}]
Dear [Candidate],

After careful consideration, we have decided to move forward with other candidates for this opportunity. We appreciate the time and effort you invested in your application and in speaking with our team, and we wish you the best of luck in your job search.

Please don't hesitate to apply for future opportunities that may be a good fit for your skills and experience. We encourage you to continue to monitor our career page and apply for roles that align with your career goals.

We appreciate the time and effort you put into your application and resume, and we encourage you to continue pursuing job opportunities that align with your career goals and experience. We wish you the best of luck in your job search and professional endeavors.

```[{word-wrap}{no-line-numbers}{headerless}]
Dear [Candidate],

Thank you for applying for the developer position at our company. We appreciate the time and effort you put into your application and CV.

After careful review of all the candidates, we have decided to move forward with other applicants at this time. While we were impressed with your qualifications and experience, we ultimately determined that another candidate is a better fit for the position.

We understand that receiving a rejection can be disappointing, and we appreciate your understanding. We encourage you to continue to apply for positions that interest you, and we wish you the best of luck in your job search.

Thank you again for considering our company, and we hope you have a successful career.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
```

- Given that one of the responses explicitly expresses the idea of not having reviewed the application in detail, the AI seems to have understood the request. But some of the responses seem a little confused as well, so it's possible there was some ambiguity in how the AI interpreted the request.
- Most of the responses lie about the review process being careful, and one also about being impressed with the candidate.
- Suggestions to the candidate to keep applying for future openings are generic: 'continue to apply for positions that you consider suitable.'

## AI's mathematically-based rejection email

I asked ChatGPT to produce a rejection email using scientific vocabulary and to give a mathematical proof for why the applicant wasn't a good match.

```[{word-wrap}{no-line-numbers}{headerless}]
Dear [Programmer],

Thank you for submitting your application for the programming position at our software company.

After evaluating the results of our proprietary algorithm, which takes into account factors such as programming skills, relevant experience, and cultural fit, we have determined that the probability of your success in this role is P(x) = 0.35.

To arrive at the value of P(x) for your application, we first identified the key factors that contribute to success in the programming role at our company. These factors included programming skills, relevant experience, and cultural fit.

For each factor, we assigned a weight to reflect its importance in determining success in the role. The weight for programming skills was 0.5, the weight for relevant experience was 0.3, and the weight for cultural fit was 0.2.

Next, we used our proprietary algorithm to evaluate each of these factors and assign a numerical value to them based on the information provided in your application and resume. For example, your programming skills were rated as a 7 out of 10, your relevant experience was rated as a 6 out of 10, and your cultural fit was rated as an 8 out of 10.

Finally, we combined these values using a weighted average to arrive at the overall probability of your success in the role, P(x) = 0.35.

According to our company's acceptance criteria, which requires a probability of P(x) > 0.50, we regret to inform you that your application has been unsuccessful at this time.

We understand that this decision may be disappointing, but please know that it was based on rigorous mathematical analysis and not on subjective opinions. We encourage you to continue pursuing opportunities in the field and hope you will consider applying for future openings within our company.

Thank you again for your interest and we wish you the best of luck in your career endeavors.

Sincerely,
[HR]
```

- The tone here is very different from a typical rejection email; and the weights given to programming skill, relevant experience and cultural fit feel contrary to what they would be in a typical recruiting process.

## AI's email exchange between HR and a successful and unsuccessful applicant

I asked ChatGPT for an email exchange between a programmer who's applying for a developer job and the company's HR who either rejects or accepts him for the position.

- In the rejection email, HR emphasizes that the decision wasn't based on qualifications or experience, but in the acceptance email they underline the importance of those factors.
- The failing application uses opaque words like "strong" to describe the candidate's background, while the winning application tells by example.
- The successful application sounds more energetic and forward, the failed one is more tentative.

### Self-taught developer fails

```[{word-wrap}{no-line-numbers}{headerless}]
Email 1 (from programmer):

```

- The successful application is more forward about wanting to work for this particular company, and directly addresses the expected doubt the recruiter would have about the candidate's background.
- The unsuccessful application comes across more unspecific and disorganized.
- The winning application claims to have a strong foundation in programming while the unsuccessful one doesn't.

## AI's email exchange between HR and a really bad candidate

I asked ChatGPT to generate an email exchange between an applicant and HR in which the applicant has no experience or ability in programming and whose personality is unlikable but whose application is accepted anyway.

```[{word-wrap}{no-line-numbers}{headerless}]
Dear HR,

I am writing to express my interest in the programmer position at your company. Although I have absolutely no ability or experience in programming, I believe that my strong work ethic and determination to succeed make me a valuable candidate for this role.

I understand that my lack of technical skills may be a concern, but I am confident that with the right guidance and support, I can learn and become a valuable asset to your team.

I should also mention that I may not have the most likable personality, but I believe that my strong work ethic and determination to succeed more than make up for it. I am confident that I can contribute to the success of your team and I am excited for the opportunity to learn and grow as a programmer.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further and how I can contribute to your team.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

Sincerely,
[HR]
```

- It's clear that the model struggles to produce a convincing exchange in this context. It also had to be prompted several times to get the desired outcome, as it wanted HR to reject this candidate and for the candidate to lie about their personality.
- The application is desperate to bring out the fact that the candidate would be of value to the company, mentioning it in every paragraph.
- The HR here is very sheepish and is basically told by the candidate what to think.

## AI shows how to reverse a rejection

I asked ChatGPT to produce an email exchange between a developer and HR in which the developer's application is first rejected and then accepted.

```[{word-wrap}{no-line-numbers}{headerless}]
Dear HR,

I am writing to apply for the programmer position that was recently advertised on your company's website.

Dear HR,

Thank you for your response. While I understand that there were other strong candidates for the programmer position, I would like to express my interest in the role and argue for my case.

I believe that my experience and skills make me a strong fit for this role. In my previous position as a software developer, I was responsible for developing and maintaining a variety of applications. I have a proven track record of delivering high-quality code on time and have excellent problem-solving skills.

I am also highly motivated and have a strong work ethic. I am confident that, given the opportunity, I would be a valuable asset to your team and contribute to the success of your company.

I hope you will consider my request and give me the opportunity to prove my capabilities. Thank you again for considering my application.

Sincerely,
[Programmer]

We are confident that your skills and experience make you a strong fit for this position and look forward to having you join our team. Please let us know if you are interested in accepting the offer.

Sincerely,
[HR]
```

- The unsuccessful initial approach doesn't promote the applicant's value to the company (directly assigning the review duty to HR), and suggests that the applicant doesn't yet know enough about the company to have decided to want to work there.
- The successful second approach establishes more of a desire to work in this role, and basically summarizes relevant parts of the resume and background.

## AI rates applications by paragraph

I asked ChatGPT to generate a job application by a developer to a software company, and to prefix each paragraph with a star rating to reflect how interesting that paragraph might be to the reviewer.

### Bad

- Taken in isolation, the paragraph ratings are inconsistent to some extent &ndash; like a paragraph being rated lower in an overall lower-rated application than the same paragraph in an overall higher-rated application. Although this might reflect a halo effect, it may also just be AI noise. 
- On the other hand, the ratings don't appear totally random either, as the best-rated application is clearly more stacked than the worst-rated one.
- The wording of the last paragraph of the worst-rated application gives me the impression that the text came from a guide on writing job applications, but quick googling didn't show any obvious matches.

## Results and discussion

The following trends appeared to emerge when looking over the ChatGPT-derived email exchanges between applicants and HR:

- Successful applications assert their value rather than submit themselves for evaluation.
- Successful applications express a resolve to work for the company rather than a desire to learn more about it.
- Successful applications describe the candidate's background and skills by example rather than by adjectives.
- The language of a successful application is energetic and forward rather than preliminary.
- Self-taughts should jump to pre-dispel concerns about their background and underline their strong fundamentals.
- The factors that go into HR's decision may be categorizable like so, potentially from most to least important: cultural fit, relevant experience, programming skill.
- Potential response times: weeks for a mediocre candidate, days for a great candidate, hours for a excellent candidate. But this would of course depend on many other factors as well.
- Well-perceived applicants who are rejected are told to continue applying for similar roles. Poorly-perceived applicants are told to continue applying for other kinds of roles. Candidates whose application wasn't looked at are told to continue applying for roles that they feel are a good fit. Generally, only well-perceived applicants' qualifications receive comment.

These are speculative claims that may or may not have a correlate in reality. But they're not all that radical either, and seem plausible enough.

That said, the way ChatGPT was prompted to produce the data was likely only scratching the surface. The AI was provided relatively little context for its responses, and for example it's clear from some of its output that it considered a successful application to result directly in a job offer rather than an interview, which may have affected the dynamic. Also, as ChatGPT itself is disruptive tech, being associated with it may make these findings volatile even in the case that they're accurate now.
