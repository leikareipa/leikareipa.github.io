I'm a very experienced graphics developer specializing in 2D image processing. I have an image in a pixel buffer (RGBA, 256x256). Write JavaScript code that applies an interesting visual effect to the pixel buffer. The effect should be something that someone like me likely doesn't often see - something interesting.
