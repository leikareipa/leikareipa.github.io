Imagine you're a ray tracer from the 1990s. You're asked to render a scene containing two spheres, one (red) in the middle of your view and another (blue) to the left of it; and a reflection of the red sphere is visible on the blue sphere. Use JavaScript to draw an image to represent your output. Don't write actual ray-tracing code, just an image to represent your most likely output.
