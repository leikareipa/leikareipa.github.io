                            How do decades-old web pages look to a modern quality assurance tool? Let's see.
                        </p>

                            <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse">Google Lighthouse</a> is a
                            tool for measuring the basic quality compliance of a given web page. The tool audits pages
                            in an automated way and outputs scores along various metrics intended to reflect the
                            quality of the page.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The <a href="https://archive.org/web/">Wayback Machine</a> is an archival service that allows
                            you to view old versions of websites. Their archives go back all the way to the 1990s &ndash;
                            see for instance <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19961112163115/http://www.nvidia.com/">
                            this punny NVIDIA website from 1996</a>.

                                I chose to run a Lighthouse audit on these five pages:

                                They were selected for being notable in their respective fields and for having
                                existed on the web from the 1990s to the time of writing.

                                For each page, I fetched a corresponding archived copy from the Wayback Machine (using the

                                            According to Lighthouse, "[t]hese checks highlight opportunities to improve the accessibility of your web app."
                                            They include things like checking whether the site has a &lt;title&gt; element, whether links have discernible names, etc.

                                            This metric includes checking whether the site has a meta description, whether its links are crawlable, etc.

                                Although commonly included in Lighthouse reports, I chose to leave out the <strong>performance</strong>
                                metric, since it was in large part just measuring the variable performance of the Wayback Machine servers.

                            <p>
                                The most notable trend is an apparent linear increase in the accessibility score over the years.
                                In the <i>late 1990s</i> group, the most common accessibility issues were missing <i>lang</i> attributes,
                                links without discernible names, and images without an <i>alt</i> attribute. The most common
                                issues in the <i>early 2020s</i> group were low contrast ratio and non-sequentially-ordered heading elements.
                                The latter group was almost void of the issues of the former group, and vice versa.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The scores for best practices don't indicate a clear trend. Virtually the only
                                issue in the <i>late 1990s</i> group was a missing <i>DOCTYPE</i> declaration, which was reported for all
                                of the sites. The <i>late 2010s</i>  group's most common issues were browser errors logged into the console
                                (possibly a side-effect of the Wayback Machine system) and the use of vulnerable JavaScript libraries
                                (their vulnerabilities known with modern hindsight and probably not widely known
                                at the time). In practical words, ignoring the noise in the results, the scores for best practices
                                look to be potentially unchanged across the sampled time.
                            </p>

                                There seems to be an uptick in search engine optimization scores on captures newer than
                                2018. My initial hunch was that this might coincide with increasing adoption of Lighthouse itself
                                (which appears to have been introduced around 2017), but if that were the case then I'd
                                expect a similar trend across the other scores, and it's not immediately obvious that there
                                is. But in any case,

                                Google's search trends</a> show elevated interest in "seo" starting in early 2020, which
                                at least co-occurs with these results.

                                Overall, the results are mildly interesting. Among the sites sampled, accessibility
                                could be interpreted to have improved over time, and there seemed to have been a recent
                                uptake of SEO focus. The results did have a fair bit of noise too, so ideally a larger
                                sample of pages &ndash; with better filtering-out of artifacts generated by the
                                Wayback Machine &ndash; would be tested to get a better feel for any patterns.

                                For more serious insight into the evolution of quality compliance on the web, you'd probably
                                also prefer to derive custom scores instead of relying only on the ones generated by Lighthouse.
                                The tool is after all a reflection of modern thinking and won't be entirely compatible
                                with that of 20 years ago. A page from 1999 may check all the boxes for accessibility for
                                its time but have a poor score with today's expectations, e.g. due to the evolution of
                                end-user devices.
