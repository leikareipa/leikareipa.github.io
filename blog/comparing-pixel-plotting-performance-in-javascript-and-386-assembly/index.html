                        <p>
                            Something that's always intrigued me is the ability to write directly into video memory
                            on legacy VGA PCs. Especially when programming with assembly, there's essentially nothing
                            between you and the monitor: write a value into an array and a pixel will light up on the screen,
                            no questions asked.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            With programming being much more abstract nowadays, I wonder, how much faster would it be
                            to draw pixels directly into video memory with assembly compared to plotting them onto a
                            HTML5 canvas with JavaScript? To find out, I carried out a few benchmarks, and will go over the
                            results in this post.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If you don't want to read through the whole post, you can <a href="#conclusion">jump
                            directly to the final results</a>. In short, I found assembly to be up to five times faster
                            &ndash; although when compared to a legacy PC from the late 1990s, JavaScript on
                            a modern system was 14 times faster.

                                I ran three benchmarks, loosely designed to mimic a real-life rendering process:
                                writing into an off-screen pixel buffer, plotting a basic per-pixel gradient, and
                                drawing pixels onto the screen.

                                Performance benchmarking is notoriously difficult to do correctly, especially across different
                                operating environments. I've done my best to ensure that the results are at least reasonably
                                meaningful; but in any case they represent one view into this topic rather than the whole
                                ground truth.

                                We'll start with a simple benchmark of filling an off-screen pixel buffer with a solid color
                                (magenta) to measure raw memory access throughput. We'll run 100 000 iterations of the fill
                                to get meaningfully long run-times (single iterations would generally be sub-millisecond).

                                In JavaScript, a &lt;canvas&gt; element's underlying pixel data is represented as an array of 8-bit
                                values, each pixel being four consecutive bytes (red, green, blue, and alpha). We'll get a
                                baseline performance reading by filling the array one color channel at a time using

                                We can improve the baseline throughput by casting the 8-bit pixel array into a 32-bit <em>Uint32Array</em>
                                view, packing the fill color's four bytes into a single 32-bit value, then duplicating the packed
                                value into all of the pixel buffer's elements with <em>Uint32Array.prototype.fill()</em>:

                                A downside of casting the pixel array into a higher-bitcount view is that the resulting
                                code is then dependent on the system's endianness.

                                A yet faster approach &ndash; and one that isn't affected by endianness &ndash; is to use
                                <em>TypedArray.prototype.copyWithin()</em> to self-replicate the buffer's data in

                                which increases the total run-time to 12 seconds or so.

                                For assembly, since each pixel in VGA mode 13h takes up one byte (that being a palette index), we can
                                store four pixels in the 32-bit <em>EAX</em> register and use the <em>REP STOSD</em> instruction
                                to duplicate them over the whole pixel buffer. It should be about the fastest way to
                                do such a fill in 386 assembly:

                                Newer Intel and AMD CPUs come with a specially-optimized <em>REP STOSB</em> that may be preferable over
                                <em>REP STOSD</em>. On the P2 platform, I did find <em>REP STOSD</em> and <em>REP STOSB</em> to perform
                                the same, so it seemed that an optimized <em>REP STOSB</em> was in action. However, on the P1,
                                <em>REP STOSB</em> was four times slower than <em>REP STOSD</em>, which would be expected in the
                                case that no special optimizations are taking place.

                                In a typical rendering scenario, you'll be plotting things more complex than solid
                                color fills. So in this second benchmark, we'll draw into an off-screen buffer a simple
                                gradient in which the shade of a pixel depends on its coordinates in the buffer.

                                For this task in JavaScript, I found both the <em>copyWithin()</em> and the 64-bit <em>fill()</em>
                                methods to perform relatively poorly (4390 and 2760 ms, respectively). The 32-bit <em>fill()</em>
                                provided the best performance:

                            <p>I optimized the above code for the fact that the gradient is horizontal, so we need to compute the shade only once per vertical row and can then <em>fill()</em> the row's pixels with that shade.</p>

                                faster than P3 coincides with a much earlier benchmark I've done in which P2 was
                                at least 50 times faster than P3 in floating-point performance.

                                The overall results of this benchmark show 386 assembly performing up to five times
                                faster than JavaScript.

                                In this final benchmark, it's finally time to display something on screen rather than just
                                plotting things into off-screen buffers. To that end, we'll transfer pixels from an off-screen
                                buffer onto a corresponding display surface &ndash; a &lt;canvas&gt; element in
                                JavaScript, and the VGA video memory in assembly.

                                As to be expected, the oldest video card (in P2) was the slowest of the bunch, while the card in P3
                                &ndash; being about three years newer than the one in P2 &ndash; was twice as fast. However, the newest
                                video card (in P1) wasn't really any faster than the one in P3, despite the latter being 15 years
                                older. I'm guessing this is due to modern video cards implementing only a bare minimum for legacy VGA support.

                                The overall results of this benchmark are fairly striking: JavaScript was at least a hundred times faster
                                than the direct video memory writes of 386 assembly. Some of the difference could be speculatively explained
                                by noting that the only modern video card (in P1) may have had crippled performance due to limited
                                legacy VGA support (we might extrapolate from the results of P2 and P3 that P1 might otherwise have posted
                                a result somewhere under 10 seconds). Another factor is that while the data transfers in assembly
                                interacted directly with video memory, JavaScript's <em>putImageData()</em> is of an abstract interface
                                whose call times may or may not include any painting into video memory.

                                From the above benchmarks we can derive an overall performance metric as follows.
                                Let's say our application has a time budget of 10 milliseconds for
                                rendering a frame. First, we'd subtract from those ten milliseconds the amount of time required to
                                copy the pixel buffer onto the screen (<a href="#drawing-to-the-screen">benchmark 3</a>),
                                then divide the remaining time by the time required to fill the pixel buffer
                                (<a href="#plotting-a-gradient">benchmark 2</a>), and finally multiply the result by the number
                                of pixels in the buffer (320 * 200 = 64 000) to get a value that represents
                                an estimate of the number of pixels we'd be able to plot per frame.

                            <p>
                                By that metric, 386 assembly was about five times faster than JavaScript when rendering a
                                simple gradient. Recalling from <a href="#drawing-to-the-screen">benchmark 3</a>, most of
                                that difference didn't come from direct access to video memory but from what appeared to
                                be speedier access to system memory and faster execution of simple computations.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                It's worth noting in closing that the assemblic benchmarks were limited to 32-bit 386 instructions.
                                Wider instructions &ndash; which a modern JavaScript engine likely benefits from &ndash;
                                would almost certainly increase the performance.
