<dokki-topic title="Recapping this year&apos;s developer job search">
<p>The developer job search has been uninspiring this year as openings have remained at record lows. The outlook for next year isn't very good either, but that's to be seen.</p>
<p>The key numbers for this year are 6% interview rate and 0% offer rate, for a developer with a few decades of background in programming and no relevant work experience. Though there's still technically about a month left in the recruiting season, I don't expect radical changes and so I'll call it early.</p>
<p>As there isn't much but rejection emails to go on, let's have a brief look at them.</p>
<dokki-subtopic title="Most boring">
<p>The award for the most numb process goes to Kesko.</p>

                        <pre>Hei %CANDIDATE%,

Kiitos hakemuksestasi ja kiinnostuksestasi K-ryhm√§√§ kohtaan.

Saimme avoimeen %POSITION% -teht√§v√§√§n runsaasti hyvi√§ hakemuksia ja olemme nyt edenneet rekrytoinnissamme. Valitettavasti valintamme ei t√§ll√§ kertaa kohdistunut Sinuun.

<p>It's the archetypal generic three-point rejection email, some variation of which is used by virtually every company on the planet.</p>
<p>What wins Kesko the honor this year is their consistency. They sent me two copies of this template for the two applications I sent them; and I don't need to translate it for you either because they sent me the English version last year:</p>

Thank you for your interest towards us üòä

If you want to give us feedback about our recruiting processes, please do so üòä Your thoughts are highly valued. Also if you still have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

<p>While their pre-screening may not be very different from Kesko's, Mehil√§inen's template is more nicely worded and I believe the recruiter added the second paragraph by hand. This nets Mehil√§inen the award of most effortful rejection email this year.</p>
</dokki-subtopic><dokki-subtopic title="About time">
<p>The median time to response was two weeks, with Kesko clocking the slowest at seven weeks. This is more or less typical for the last few years.</p>
