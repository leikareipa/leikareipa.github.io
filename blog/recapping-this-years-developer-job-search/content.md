# Recapping this year's developer job search

The developer job search has been uninspiring this year as openings have remained at record lows. The outlook for next year isn't very good either, but that's to be seen.

The key numbers for this year are 6% interview rate and 0% offer rate, for a developer with a few decades of background in programming and no relevant work experience. Though there's still technically about a month left in the recruiting season, I don't expect radical changes and so I'll call it early.

As there isn't much but rejection emails to go on, let's have a brief look at them.

## Most boring

The award for the most numb process goes to Kesko.

```[{word-wrap}{no-line-numbers}{headerless}]
Hei %CANDIDATE%,

Kiitos hakemuksestasi ja kiinnostuksestasi K-ryhm√§√§ kohtaan.

Saimme avoimeen %POSITION% -teht√§v√§√§n runsaasti hyvi√§ hakemuksia ja olemme nyt edenneet rekrytoinnissamme. Valitettavasti valintamme ei t√§ll√§ kertaa kohdistunut Sinuun.

Voit seurata jatkossa avoimia ty√∂paikkojamme osoitteessa %URL%
```

It's the archetypal generic three-point rejection email, some variation of which is used by virtually every company on the planet.

What wins Kesko the honor this year is their consistency. They sent me two copies of this template for the two applications I sent them; and I don't need to translate it for you either because they sent me the English version last year:

```[{word-wrap}{no-line-numbers}{headerless}]
Hi %CANDIDATE%,

Thank you for your application and the interest you have shown towards K Group.

We received many good applications for the position of %POSITION%, and we are now moving forward with the recruitment. Unfortunately, this time we have not chosen to proceed with you.

## Most effortful

This year, Mehil√§inen showed the most effort in their rejection email.

```[{word-wrap}{no-line-numbers}{headerless}]
Hi,

Thank you for your interest towards us üòä  

You definitely have interesting skills but unfortunately, your work experience, skills and interests don't quite match with what we are looking for to our team at the moment. Due to that we cannot continue this recruiting process with you. 

We hope that you will still keep us in your mind, follow our job advertisements, and send us new application if you find something interesting again.

If you want to give us feedback about our recruiting processes, please do so üòä Your thoughts are highly valued. Also if you still have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

I hope you all the best!
```

While their pre-screening may not be very different from Kesko's, Mehil√§inen's template is more nicely worded and I believe the recruiter added the second paragraph by hand. This nets Mehil√§inen the award of most effortful rejection email this year.

## About time

The median time to response was two weeks, with Kesko clocking the slowest at seven weeks. This is more or less typical for the last few years.
