<dokki-topic title="Messing around with Electron">
<p>I had reason recently to convert one of my software, <a href="/#lintulista">Lintulista</a>, from a full-stack web app into a desktop application.</p>
<p>Normally, I'd use C++ with Qt for building the desktop stuff, but didn't want to rewrite this JavaScript codebase. Instead, I was able to use <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a> to easily glue the app's server and client together into a desktop-runnable bundle.</p>
<p>In this post, I'll blurt out a few words about the experience, which was my first time with Electron.</p>
<dokki-subtopic title="Setting up">
<p>Electron is <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/quick-start">quite simple to set up and get running</a>. In short, you install the <em>electron</em> package, create a <strong>package.json</strong> file for it with some metainformation about your project, and add a bit of JavaScript code to tell Electron how to run the application.</p>
<p>In Lintulista's case, the runner code only needs to do two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start the server</li>
<li>Start the client</li>
</ol>
<h3>Starting the server</h3>
<p>Lintulista's server is a regular old Node.js job that takes requests and comes up with responses. While the original version of the server used an SQL database, I replaced it here with a plain flat-file one to cut down on dependencies and make the app easier to distribute.</p>
<p>Starting the server for Electron is straightforward:</p>

                <dokki-code syntax="javascript"headerless="true">
                    <template #code>
                        <pre>const {LL_ProcessRequest} = require(&quot;../server/process-request.js&quot;);
require(&quot;http&quot;).createServer(LL_ProcessRequest).listen(LL_SERVER_PORT, &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;); 
</pre>
                    </template>
                </dokki-code>
            
<h3>Starting the client</h3>
<p>With the server running, the client can be started as well:</p>

                <dokki-code syntax="javascript"headerless="true">
                    <template #code>
                        <pre>const mainWindow = new Electron.BrowserWindow({show: false});

mainWindow.loadFile(&quot;../client/index.html&quot;);

mainWindow.on(&quot;ready-to-show&quot;, ()=&gt;{
    mainWindow.show();
    mainWindow.focus();
});
</pre>
                    </template>
                </dokki-code>
            
<p>The code will pop out a window displaying Lintulista's React-powered front-end, which interacts with the server as the user navigates the page.</p>

                        </dokki-image>
</dokki-subtopic><dokki-subtopic title="Distributable footprint">
<p>As I was only targeting a single platform (Linux), there didn't seem to be a need for custom build tools. I simply distributed the program's source code along with Electron's modules.</p>
<p>I organized the app's distributable like this:</p>
<dokki-directory headerless>
    <template #structure>
        'client': {
            '/type': 'folder',
        },
        'database': {
            '/type': 'folder',
        },
        'electron': {
            '/type': 'folder',
        },
        'server': {
            '/type': 'folder',
        },
        'lintulista': {}
    </template>
</dokki-directory>
<p>It's a clean and intuitive directory listing for the user â€“ the program's code and Electron fluff are hidden under subdirectories, and the <strong>lintulista</strong> launch script is discoverable at first glance.</p>
<p>The launch script calls Electron's binary with a user-provided command-line parameter identifying the database resource to operate on:</p>

                <dokki-code syntax="bash"headerless="true">
                    <template #code>
                        <pre>./electron/node_modules/electron/dist/electron ./electron/. $1
</pre>
                    </template>
                </dokki-code>
            
<p>The app can then be launched with <em>./lintulista resource_id</em>.</p>
</dokki-subtopic><dokki-subtopic title="My impressions of Electron">
<p>My first impression of Electron was that it's easy to set up. You install its package, leaf through their quick-start guide, and a few minutes later you have your previously web-based app running on your desktop. Full disclosure: I tried <a href="https://nwjs.io/">NW.js</a> before settling on Electron, but found the former messier to set up and distribute.</p>
<p>One downside of Electron was that it apparently tries not to be opinionated. For example, despite this being a predictable need, there was no standard way of persisting application settings. With Qt you might use <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qsettings.html">QSettings</a>, but Electron apps are <a href="https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/526">left to implement their own solutions and reinvent stumbling-block workarounds</a>.</p>
<p>A larger problem was that it felt ass-backwards to build desktop software with the JavaScript front-end ecosystem that's specifically not supposed to run with elevated access. <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/security">Security with Electron</a> appeared fairly complicated and easy to get wrong, and potential vulnerabilities felt like a feature of the framework.</p>
<p>Still, this virgin developer experience I had with Electron was quite pleasant overall, and allowed a rapid transformation of a web app into a desktop application. I don't think I'll be diving head-first into building desktop software from the ground up with Electron, but it's a neat tool for limited purposes.</p>
